  <b><h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1></b><br>
<br>
<br>

<b>How the Web Works</b><br><br>

-The web is a collection of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.apple.com, their computer sends a <i>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</i> Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.<br><br><br>

<b>HTML</b><br><br><br>

-HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>. HTML documents make up the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes what you see and markup which describes how it looks.<br><br><br>

<b>Tags and Elements</b><br><br>

-HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.<br><br><br>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>

-Computers are <i>stupid</i> because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.<br><br><br>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b><br>

-HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.<br><br><br>
<h2>LESSON 2: CREATING A STRUCTURED DOCUMENT WITH HTML</h2><br><br><br>

<b>Building a House</b><br><br><br>
-If you compare a website to a house, HTML is the structure (where the walls are placed, etc), CSS is the style (what color are the walls, etc), and Java Script is the interactive components (TV remote, garage opener, etc.)<h1 style="color:blue">This is a Blue Heading</h1><br><br><br>
<b> A Tree of Code</b><br><br><br>
The nodes of an HTML document are layed out as a tree-like structure called the DOM <i>(document object model)</i> or the DOM tree. Nodes <i>(sideways triangles)</i> are HTML elements each with an opening and closing tag.<br><br><br>
<b>Boxes on Boxes on Boxes</b><br><br><br>
Everything you see on a webpage can be broken down into boxes.What you see within those boxes can be altered using different languages (HTML, CSS, Java, etc).<br><br><br>
<h3> Notes </h3><br><br><br>

<b>Validation</b><br>

-To help you pass the HTML/CSS validation check, you should go to these two websites that will run your code and tell you whether your HTML and CSS code validates or not.<br><br>

-HTML validation: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input<br><br>

-CSS validation: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input<br><br>

-<div>The <div> tag</div><br><br>

-The div tag is one of the most important tags to organize our HTML. Div tags help us divide our other HTML elements into sections that we can then treat as one whole group such as:<br><br>

<div class="red-text-color">
   <p>Any text that appears here is red!</p>
   <p>I have another paragraph grouped under this division that also has red text</p>
</div><br><br>

<div class="green-text-color">
   <p>Now I'm grouping this paragraph and the next paragraph into a division that has green text. Any text that appears here is green!</p><br><br>
   <p>I have another paragraph grouped under this division that also has green text</p>
</div><br><br>
Specifically for this project, we want you to organize your code notes into sections where each section is created by using a div tag. Andy's example submission shows how he uses div tags to divide up his HTML into sections where he then writes notes for each concept that he learned through out the course.<br><br>

<b>1. Procedural Thinking</b><br><br>

Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.<br><br>

It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a computer to do that requires more thought. But once you've learned to think this way you'll find that computers can do it much faster.<br><br>

<b>2. Abstract Thinking</b><br><br>

Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.<br><br>

In this Nanodegree you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each of these pages individually. The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.<br><br>

<b>3. Systems Thinking</b><br><br>

Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree.<br><br>

<b>4. Technological Empathy<br><br><br>

"Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.<br><br>

A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages used to write them. It's almost impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these tools work.<br><br>

  <b>5. Debugging</b><br><br><br>

Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.<br><br>

When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code. Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that system usually looks something like this:<br><br>

  <i>Collect evidence</i> (what makes this program fail?)<br>
  <i>Generate theories</i> (what may have caused this problem?)<br>
  <i>Test those theories</i> (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)
Fix the problem<br>
<br>
